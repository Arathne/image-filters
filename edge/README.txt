I am quite certain that the 5x5 filter is correct since I checked some values by hand. 

It's possible that the filter I used is wrong, feel free to change the values in edge.cpp. Then
rerun the program which will generate a bunch of files.

I hope you wont punish me on memory leaks since I didn't really do any memory management.

I will leave a comment in canvas that will link to the resulting images.
